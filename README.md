# opensource-contrib
Project used to centralize contributions we want to make to open source projects

The contributions we'll be listed as issues on this project to use the status tracking system of issues.

## TODO
Check the Github's project and teams workflow whether it would be more suitable for this project instead of the issue workflow.
